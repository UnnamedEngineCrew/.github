# Welcome to the Unnamed Engine Crew

Hey there, thanks for stopping by.
We're just a small team of developers who decided to take a fresh approach. Unnamed Engine is our little project where we rewrote our engine from scratch, experimenting and learning as we go.

## Who We Are

We're not a huge corporation or anything fancy. We're a group of people who love coding, problem-solving, and the occasional late-night debugging session. If you're curious about how we do things or want to share your ideas, you've come to the right place.

## What We're Up To

Our project is a work in progress. We're always tweaking, testing, and trying out new ideas to improve the engine. There are plenty of updates, experiments, and code commits that tell the story of our journey.

### Thanks for visiting!
