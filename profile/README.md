# Welcome to the Unnamed Engine Crew

Hey there, thanks for stopping by.
Unnamed Engine is our little project where we rewrote [Friday Night Funkin'](https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin) engine from scratch, experimenting and learning as we go.

## Who We Are

We're just a small team of developers who decided to take a fresh approach. We're not a huge corporation or anything fancy, we're some friends who love coding.

## What We're Up To

Our project is a work in progress. We're always tweaking, testing, and trying out new ideas to improve the engine. There are plenty of updates, experiments, and cool stuff we want to put in player's hands.

### Thanks for visiting!
