# Welcome to the Unnamed Engine Crew

Hello and thanks for checking out our GitHub space!

We're a small group of developers passionate about building something unique. At Unnamed Engine, we started fresh—rewriting our engine from scratch—to create a more modular, efficient, and enjoyable platform for developers.

## Who We Are

We're not a massive corporation; we're a team that values clean code, creative problem-solving, and a collaborative spirit. Whether you're here to contribute, learn, or just see what we're up to, we're glad you stopped by.

## What We're Up To

Unnamed Engine is our ongoing project and playground for innovation. We’re constantly experimenting, refining, and pushing the boundaries to build an engine that empowers creators. Expect regular updates and improvements as we continue our journey.

### Thanks for visiting!
